                                        requires at least one product image, and
                                        we recommend that you
                                        provide six images and one video. Good
                                        images make it easy for customers to
                                        evaluate the product. Images
                                        should be clear, informative, and
                                        attractive. The first image on the
                                        product detail page is the "MAIN"
                                        image and is shown to customers in
                                        search. The MAIN image must show only
                                        the product for sale on a white
                                        background, and the product should fill
                                        the image frame. Additional images
                                        should show the product in use
                                        or in an environment, different angles,
                                        and different features.</p>

                                        application, simply right-click one of

                                        it to your desktop. You can size this

                                        larger, as it will be distorted.
                                        If you need a larger logo for screen
                                        use, download the high-resolution JPEG
                                        instead.</p>

                                        large image, but it can be made smaller
