        <p>THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT GOVERN YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES THROUGH A PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OR ACCOUNTS AND IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU OR THE BUSINESS YOU REPRESENT ("YOU") AND ALLY MART SELLER SERVICES PRIVATE LIMITED. BY REGISTERING FOR OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU (ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF OR THE BUSINESS YOU REPRESENT) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE SERVICE TERMS AND PROGRAM POLICIES FOR EACH SERVICE YOU REGISTER FOR OR USE IN CONNECTION WITH THE ALLY MART SITE.</p>
        <p>As used in this Agreement, "we," "us," and "Ally Mart" means the Ally Mart company named in the applicable Service Terms. Capitalized terms have the meanings listed in the <a href="">Definitions</a> below. If there is any conflict between these General Terms and the applicable Service Terms and Program Policies, the General Terms will govern and the applicable Service Terms will prevail over the Program Policies.</p>
        <h6>1. Enrolment</h6>
        <p>To begin the enrolment process, you must complete the registration process for one or more of the Services. Use of the Services is limited to parties that can lawfully enter into and form contracts under applicable Law. As part of the application, you must provide us with your (or your business') legal name, address, phone number, e-mail address, applicable tax registration details as well as any other information we may request. Any personal data you provide to us will be handled in accordance with <a href="">Ally Mart’s Privacy Notice.</a></p>
        <h6>2. Service Fee Payments</h6>
        <p>Fee details are described fully in the applicable Service Terms and Program Policies. You are responsible for all of your expenses in connection with this Agreement, unless this Agreement or the applicable Service Terms provide otherwise. For the Ally Mart Site that you register for or use a Service in connection with, we may require you to submit valid credit card information from a credit card acceptable by Ally Mart (with respect to such Ally Mart Site, "Your Credit Card") as well as valid bank account information for a bank account in your name that is with a bank located within India and enabled for Your Account (which functionality may be modified or discontinued by us at any time without notice) (with respect to the Ally Mart Site, "Your Bank Account"). You will use only a name you are authorized to use in connection with the Service and will update such information as necessary to ensure that it at all times remains accurate and complete. You authorize us to verify your information (including any updated information), to obtain credit reports about you from time to time, to obtain credit authorizations from the issuer of Your Credit Card, and to charge Your Credit Card or debit Your Bank Account for any sums payable by you to us (in reimbursement or otherwise). At Ally Mart's option, all payments to you will be made to Your Bank Account, via cheque or electronic transfers or other means as specified by us. You agree that Ally Mart shall not be liable for any failure to make payments to you on account of incomplete or inaccurate information provided by you with respect to Your Bank Account.
            In addition to charging payable sums to Your Credit Card, we may instead choose to either (a) offset any amounts that are payable by you to us (in reimbursement or otherwise) against any payments we may make to you, or (b) invoice you for amounts due to us, in which case you will pay the invoiced amounts upon receipt. Except as provided otherwise, all amounts contemplated in this Agreement will be expressed and displayed in the Local Currency, and all payments contemplated by this Agreement will be made in the Local Currency. If we discover erroneous or duplicate transactions, then we reserve the right to seek reimbursement from you by deducting from future payments owed to you, charging Your Credit Card, or seeking such reimbursement from you by any other lawful means; provided that the foregoing will not limit your rights to pursue any good faith dispute with Ally Mart concerning whether any amounts are payable or due.
            If we reasonably conclude based on information available to us that your actions and/or performance in connection with the Agreement may result in a significant number of customer disputes, chargebacks or other claims in connection with the Ally Mart Site, then we may, in our sole discretion and subject to applicable Law, delay initiating any payments to be made or that are otherwise due to you under this Agreement for the shorter of: (a) a period of ninety (90) calendar days following the initial date of suspension; or (b) completion of any investigation(s) regarding your actions and/or performance in connection with the Agreement. You agree that we are entitled to the interest, if any, paid on balances maintained as deposits in our bank accounts.
            </p>
            <h6>3. Term and Termination </h6>
            <p>The term of this Agreement will start on the date of your completed registration for use of one or more of the Services and continue until terminated by us or you as provided below. You may at any time terminate your use of any Service immediately on notice to us via Seller Central, email, the Contact Us Form, or similar means. We may terminate your use of any Services or terminate this Agreement for convenience with 30 days’ advance notice. We may suspend or terminate your use of any Services immediately if we determine that (a) you have materially breached the Agreement and failed to cure within 7 days of a cure notice unless your breach exposes us to liability towards a third party, in which case we are entitled to reduce, or waive, the aforementioned cure period at our reasonable discretion; (b) your account has been, or our controls identify that it may be used for deceptive or fraudulent or illegal activity; or (c) your use of the Services has harmed or our controls identify that it might harm other sellers, customers, or Ally Mart’s legitimate interests; or (d) your <a href="">Account Health Rating</a> falls below our published threshold(s) for deactivation. We will promptly notify you of any such termination or suspension via email or similar means including Seller Central, indicating the reason and any options to appeal, except where we have reason to believe that providing this information will hinder the investigation or prevention of deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or will enable you to circumvent our safeguards.
